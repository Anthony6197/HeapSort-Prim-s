# HeapSort
So we setup a constructor which initializes the array, the size, and transforming the array to a heap. 
Then we built some basic method which gets the lchid, rchild, the parent, is Empty, etc. 
Then we built the walk up and walk down which checks the node's corresponding heap with it as a child and as a parent as we moves through.
Finally we kept deleting the largest node/ the root and keep making sure the order of the heap is right until every node is being deleted.
And that returns us the order from small to large of the array.

The average time is less than the provided one.
